=head1 NAME

InterceptAllMethods - export ClassHOW to intercept all method calls

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use InterceptAllMethods;
 
    class FooBar {
        method ^find_method(Mu $obj, Str $name) {
            return -> | { say "calling $name" }
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Change the ClassHOW of the compilation unit so that you can create a class
that has a C<^find_method> that will be called for B<any> method call to that
class.  This method should then return a C<Callable> that will called as if
it were the method.

This allows one to implement one's own caching methods, or not have any caching
method at all.
