NAME
====

InterceptAllMethods - export ClassHOW to intercept all method calls

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use InterceptAllMethods;

class FooBar {
    method ^find_method(Mu $obj, Str $name) {
        return -> | { say "calling $name" }
    }
}
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Change the ClassHOW of the compilation unit so that you can create a class that has a `^find_method` that will be called for **any** method call to that class. This method should then return a `Callable` that will called as if it were the method.

This allows one to implement one's own caching methods, or not have any caching method at all.
